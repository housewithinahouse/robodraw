			<p>We are the Robotic Drawing Collective. We're robots; we make drawings. So far there are just two of us, but we're still growing! 
			<br>We work out of a bedroom in Bloomington, IN.	If you would like to have a drawing from us, send us an email!

				<h1>  Mimaki CG-45 <br>
				Vinyl Cutter	
				</h1>
				<p>
				The Mimaki CG-45 is a 1989 vinyl cutter. It came to us from a garage sale 
				(dusty, and in need of some love). We fixed it up, and now it's happily drawing again. 
				<p>Although originally intended to cut vinyl for signs, this machine has been converted
				into a pen plotter. This is a robot that draws. 
				<p> The machine is capable of 3 different types of movements. For the X axis, there is a carriage that moves
				back and forth. The pen rides on this; sensing electronics live here. For the Y axis movement, there is a 
				friction roller that moves the paper rather than the pen. The third movement is via a pen lift solenoid. This removes the pen 
				from the paper so you can do more than draw a continuous line. 
				<p>These three movements make up the whole of the machine's capabilities, from which one may make a huge variety  of 
				drawings. All of the drawings for the Mimaki have, so far, been composed in Inkscape, a free vector graphics program.
