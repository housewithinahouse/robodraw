Why is the .xsession-errors.old file so big?	

Problem:
Many users (including me) found out from one moment to another that the
 usage disk space is really strange. One day I had 50Gb free and the next I
had 3Gb, it is just crazy.

This happened with different versions of Ubuntu (11.04, 12.04 and 12.10 just
to mention).

Some of those user have create question on this site, some of them:

    Disk Usage Very Strange
    Ubuntu 12.10 recognizes me only 3GB of free space
    Why am I getting low disk space usage?

Solution

@NathanWienand have discovered that the problem was caused by the .xsession-errors.old file (it can be found on the $HOME directory) and he and others user solved the problem removing the file. An example of the size that can have this file is ~100Gb, not reasonable..

Question

    Why does this happen?
    Is deleting the file the only way to solve it?
    Isn't there another way to solve this with a large period effect?
   
----------------------------------------------------------------
I would just stop them being created by running these command:

rm .xsession-errors.old

touch .xsession-errors.old

sudo chattr +i .xsession-errors.old

So delete the file, create a new one, and then set the immutable attribute to stop anything writing or reading it.

You will need to logout.

Hope it helps.
--------------------------
I really don't know what the third command does. Explain a bit further please. Do you mean, create the file so nothing can write it? Also, the file is not .xsession-errors but .xsession-errors.old – Lucio Jun 30 at 19:23
	
Yes, the 3rd command will basically lock the file up so nothing can write or read it. Not even root. The only way to unlock it is by running sudo chattr -i .xsession-error.old Here is a wiki page on the chattr command: chattr – BiggJJ Jun 30 at 19:46
	
But why I would do something like that? That is not a solution. Don't forget that the file has a purpose for the system. – Lucio Jun 30 at 19:47
	
It would stop huge amounts of data being written to the file. As I said, I am not sure why it happens, but this is one way to stop it happening. – BiggJJ Jun 30 at 19:49
