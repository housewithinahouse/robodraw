		 This section is where everything that changes from page to page lives. 
		 Currently we've have a couple of options for formating:
		 info: all text on gallery pages needs to be wrapped in this, takes up a half-space. 
		 little: which is for subtitles.
		 p: most text, indents first line
		 h1: for gallery title, centered, in a box. 
		 Images have their own classes: quarter, third, half.

					<h1>  Circles | Itterated Forms 
					<br>  &#151; 2012 &#151;	
					</h1>
					
					<!-- Main Text -->
					<p>These nested circles were made to test calibration on our newest family member, 
					the Mimaki CG-45. It was having trouble with losing registration, and these circles
					were a way of troubleshooting. A quick opening up, and the problem was solved. 
					<p>Circles have a very simple geometry, and ever after calibration, we've continued
					to make more of pages of circles, repeating and transfoming them around the page.
					<p>More circles someday!
					
					<!--Software/Hardware -->
					<p class="little">
					These were designed using <a href="http://www.inkscape.org">Inkscape</a> + <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>,<br>
					and executed by a <a href="!!!!">modified Mimaki CG-45 Vinyl Cutter</a><br>
					<!-- Materials -->
					<p class="little">
					These are drawn with a Uniball Deluxe Fine<br> 
					on 80lb Sawgrass Cardstock.
